# Pong Game (with Functional Programming) 

In the context of the Programming Paradigms course, I developed a pong game leveraging Functional Reactive Programming principles. 
The game was crafted using TypeScript and employed RxJS Observable streams for fluid animation and interactive user experiences. 
My primary contributions were in the 'pong.ts' file, which serves as the game's core code. 
Additionally, I refined 'pong.html' to optimize the game's foundational layout and design. 
Initial code templates were generously provided by Professor Tim Dwyer.
